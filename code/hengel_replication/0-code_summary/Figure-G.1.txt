OPERATIONS
----------
- Creates a continuous blind-review policy change variable centered at the volume where the policy changed
- For each of 5 readability measures (Flesch, Flesch-Kincaid, Gunning Fog, SMOG, Dale-Chall): residualizes readability changes after controlling for covariates; estimates separate regressions for gender and seniority groups; uses margins to plot predicted changes by distance from the policy-change point
- Compares double-blind (pre-internet) vs. single-blind (post-internet) periods
- Creates a combined graph with a policy-change annotation line
