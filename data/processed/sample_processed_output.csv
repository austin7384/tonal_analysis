Due to limited inventory of the product and the short sales horizon, a resale market emerges where products may resell at higher prices once the firm stocks out. The firm faces a central tradeoff: pricing too high may lead to a longer stockout time and future markdowns; pricing too low may lead to transfer of profits to resellers. Any firm in this position may ask, “How do resellers impact my profit?” To answer this question, we build a dynamic structural model that captures customer decisions to consume or strategically resell, as well as the firm’s intertemporal pricing decision in the presence of resellers. We estimate our model using a unique data set from a retailer of baby clothing with weekly product drops, where customers engage in a resale marketplace through Facebook groups. We find resale data collection and analysis is valuable to incorporate into pricing as firm profit increases by 8.8%, and reseller presence reduces firm profit by 5.8% even if resale data are used in pricing. These impacts are magnified by resale market growth, demonstrating that managers need to take action as resale markets gain wider adoption.","{'sections': [{'criterion': 'Modal Verb Strength', 'justification': 'Multiple weak modals appear: “may resell,” “may lead …,” “may lead …,” and “may ask.” No strong modals like “will,” “must,” or “cannot” occur.', 'score': 1}, {'criterion': 'Hedging Frequency & Type', 'justification': 'Hedging via modal “may” occurs several times (“may resell,” “may lead …”), while there are no stance phrases like “we believe/it seems.”', 'score': 4}, {'criterion': 'Qualifier Density', 'justification': 'Few softening qualifiers; claims are largely unsoftened and include precise figures (“increases by 8.8%,” “reduces by 5.8%”).

Our economic model comprises a startup, a crowdfunding platform, and two VC firms, each with its own perception of the startup’s potential. The startup seeks equity funding from the VC firms and decides on the size of its equity offer. If the VC firms decline to invest, the startup pivots to crowdfunding. Following the crowdfunding campaign, all firms update their beliefs about the startup’s likelihood of success based on the crowdfunding outcome, prompting the VC firms to revisit their investment decisions, now with a reduced equity offer if the crowdfunding outcome was positive. This study provides theoretical underpinnings at the firm level for the observed aggregate-level empirical relationships, both positive and negative, between crowdfunding and VC investments. Specifically, based on our model, the positive relationship, where increased crowdfunding activity leads to a rise in subsequent VC investments, is attributed to startups that fail to secure VC funding in the absence of a crowdfunding platform but succeed in attracting VC attention after a successful crowdfunding campaign. In contrast, the negative relationship is attributed to highly valued startups that could have secured VC funding without crowdfunding, but with crowdfunding, VC firms choose to defer their investment decision until after the crowdfunding campaign’s result is known; on the one hand, a successful crowdfunding outcome lowers their post-crowdfunding VC investment demand, and on the other hand, an unsuccessful outcome deters potential VC investors.

Our economic model comprises a startup, a crowdfunding platform, and two VC firms, each with its own perception of the startup’s potential. The startup seeks equity funding from the VC firms and decides on the size of its equity offer. If the VC firms decline to invest, the startup pivots to crowdfunding. Following the crowdfunding campaign, all firms update their beliefs about the startup’s likelihood of success based on the crowdfunding outcome, prompting the VC firms to revisit their investment decisions, now with a reduced equity offer if the crowdfunding outcome was positive. This study provides theoretical underpinnings at the firm level for the observed aggregate-level empirical relationships, both positive and negative, between crowdfunding and VC investments. Specifically, based on our model, the positive relationship, where increased crowdfunding activity leads to a rise in subsequent VC investments, is attributed to startups that fail to secure VC funding in the absence of a crowdfunding platform but succeed in attracting VC attention after a successful crowdfunding campaign. In contrast, the negative relationship is attributed to highly valued startups that could have secured VC funding without crowdfunding, but with crowdfunding, VC firms choose to defer their investment decision until after the crowdfunding campaign’s result is known; on the one hand, a successful crowdfunding outcome lowers their post-crowdfunding VC investment demand, and on the other hand, an unsuccessful outcome deters potential VC investors.

Wu,information systems,"This study investigates how tie formation shapes the production of user-generated content on social media, offering insights into enhancing user engagement and alleviating social media fatigue. We conceptualize tie formation as a relationship codevelopment process involving a tie initiator and a respondent. Drawing on social psychology literature, we propose a framework that traces how initiators’ social cognition evolves throughout this process—from proactively extending an inviting social tie to receiving a responsive one in return. Central to our framework is a perceptual mechanism we termrelational resonance, which fosters intrinsic motivation and prompts initiators to adjust their content creation. Using data from YouTube, we develop a Bayesian hierarchical model to identify individual creators’ content adjustments, measured by changes in video volume and viewer engagement. Our results reveal that while initiators tend to reduce content production after receiving a responsive tie, the videos they create generate higher engagement, with “like” and “subscribe” rates increasing by 1.1 and 2.9 percentage points, respectively. Remarkably, the receipt of a responsive tie leads to average weekly increases of 66 likes and 183 subscriptions even after accounting for the decrease in video volume, reinforcing the “quality over quantity” principle in content creation strategies.

To address this important research question, we designed two survey modules that enable us to calculate the extent to which confidence matters for both financial literacy and behavior.

This paper develops a tractable methodology that a platform can use to optimize its match recommendation policy to maximize the total value generated by the platform while accounting for the endogeneity of transaction prices, which are set by the providers based on supply and demand and can depend on the platform’s match recommendation policy. Despite the complications of price endogeneity, an optimal match recommendation policy has a simple structure and can be computed efficiently. In particular, an optimal policy always recommends the providers who deliver the highest conversion rates. Moreover, an optimal policy can be encoded simply in terms of the frequency of recommending each provider to each customer segment, without the need to encode which subsets of providers are to be recommended together. On the other hand, if the platform were to optimize its match recommendations without accounting for price endogeneity, then the resultant policy would be more complex, and the market is likely to get stuck at a strictly suboptimal outcome, even if the platform were to continually reoptimize its match recommendations after prices re-equilibrate.","{'sections': [{'criterion': 'Modal Verb Strength', 'justification': 'Frequent weak modals: “can use,” “can depend,” “can be computed,” “can be encoded,” plus hypothetical “would be” and “were to.” No strong modals like “will,” “must,” or “cannot.”', 'score': 1}, {'criterion': 'Hedging Frequency & Type', 'justification': 'Multiple hedging/possibility markers: “can depend,” “can be computed,” “can be encoded,” conditional “if the platform were to…,” and probabilistic “is likely to get stuck.”', 'score': 3}, {'criterion': 'Qualifier Density', 'justification': 'Few softening qualifiers; no phrases like “to some extent” or “relatively.” Only notable softener is “likely.” Other modifiers (“simple,” “efficiently,” “always”) are not softening.', 'score': 9}, {'criterion': 'Acknowledgement of Limitations', 'justification': 'No explicit caveats or boundary conditions about the methodology’s limits are stated.', 'score': 10}, {'criterion': 'Caution-Signaling Connectors', 'justification': 'Uses concessive/contrastive connectors occasionally: “Despite the complications…,” “On the other hand.”', 'score': 5}, {'criterion': 'Assertiveness & Voice', 'justification': 'Strong, unequivocal assertions: “an optimal…has a simple structure,” “can be computed efficiently,” “an optimal policy always recommends…,” and outcome claims (“market is likely to get stuck”).

How does the format of these time estimates affect customers’ satisfaction? In particular, should companies provide customers with a point estimate representing the best estimate, or should they communicate the inherent uncertainty in outcomes by providing a range estimate? In eight preregistered experiments (N= 5,323), participants observed time estimates provided by an app, and we manipulated whether the app presented the time estimates as a point estimate (e.g., “Your food will arrive in 45 minutes.”) or a range (e.g., “Your food will arrive in 40–50 minutes.”). After participants learned about the app’s prediction performance by sampling a set of past outcomes, we measured participants’ evaluation of the app. We find that participants judged the app more positively when it provided a range rather than a point estimate. These results held across different domains, different time durations, different underlying outcome distributions, and an incentive-compatible design. We also find that this preference is not simply due to people’s dislike of late outcomes, as participants also rated ranges more positively than conservative point estimates corresponding to the upper (i.e., later) bound of the range. These findings suggest that companies can increase customer satisfaction with realized time estimates by communicating the uncertainty inherent in these time estimates.","{'sections': [{'criterion': 'Modal Verb Strength', 'justification': 'Uses stronger/deontic or definitive modals and no weak ones: “should companies provide…”, “should they communicate…”, “companies can increase…”, and strong “will” appears in examples (“Your food will arrive…”).

We explore the design of the first-stage test—specifically the selection of f-Hb cutoffs to report test outcomes—to balance screening effectiveness (CRC and polyp detection) and efficiency (colonoscopy costs), considering that not all individuals follow up with a colonoscopy. We propose an information design model that integrates Bayesian persuasion with information avoidance to address this issue. The model is applied to the design of Singapore’s CRC screening program and calibrated using data from multiple sources, including a nationwide survey of 3,920 respondents in Singapore. Our findings indicate that under certain conditions, using a single cutoff maximizes follow-up adherence, whereas showing exact f-Hb readings optimizes detection effectiveness. Raising the cutoff to 39μg/g, as compared with the current practice, could detect 21% more CRC and polyp cases, reduce colonoscopies by 27%, and lower lifetime CRC risk by 11%. This adjustment would reduce public healthcare expenditure by S$20 million and individual spending by S$12 million on average in screening costs. Choosing appropriate cutoffs for the first-stage test can significantly enhance the screening effectiveness while efficiently managing colonoscopy demands. The prevalent practice of using lower cutoffs to achieve high sensitivity may lead to excessive unnecessary colonoscopies and reduced follow-up adherence.","{'sections': [{'criterion': 'Modal Verb Strength', 'justification': 'Uses only weak modals: “could detect,” “would reduce,” “can significantly enhance,” “may lead to.” No strong modals like “will,” “must,” or “cannot.”', 'score': 1}, {'criterion': 'Hedging Frequency & Type', 'justification': 'Some hedging present: “under certain conditions,” plus modal hedges (“could,” “would,” “can,” “may”).

One of the leading explanations is mechanism complexity. We propose a novel way of describinganystrategy-proof mechanism with the aim to reduce the ensuing cognitive load on players and, hence, to increase truthful reporting. The description highlights that a player is guaranteed to obtain a most preferred feasible allocation based on her reported type and that feasibility depends only on the other players’ reports.

In this paper, we develop a method for planning bike lanes that accounts for ridership and congestion effects. We first present a procedure for estimating parameters of a traffic equilibrium model, which combines an inverse optimization method for predicting driving times with an instrumental variables method for estimating a commuter mode choice model. We then formulate a prescriptive model that selects paths in a road network for bike lane installation while endogenizing cycling demand and driving travel times. We conduct an empirical study on the City of Chicago that brings together several data sets that describe the urban environment—including the road and bike lane networks, vehicle flows, commuter mode choices, bike share trips, driving and cycling routes, demographic features, and points of interest—with the goal of estimating the impact of expanding Chicago’s bike lane network. We estimate that adding 25 miles of bike lanes as prescribed by our model can lift cycling ridership from 3.6% to 6.1%, with at most a 9.4% increase in driving times.

In recent years, municipal governments have invested heavily in the expansion of bike lane networks to meet growing demand, promote ridership, and reduce emissions. However, reallocating road capacity to cycling is often contentious because of the risk of amplifying traffic congestion. In this paper, we develop a method for planning bike lanes that accounts for ridership and congestion effects. We first present a procedure for estimating parameters of a traffic equilibrium model, which combines an inverse optimization method for predicting driving times with an instrumental variables method for estimating a commuter mode choice model. We then formulate a prescriptive model that selects paths in a road network for bike lane installation while endogenizing cycling demand and driving travel times. We conduct an empirical study on the City of Chicago that brings together several data sets that describe the urban environment—including the road and bike lane networks, vehicle flows, commuter mode choices, bike share trips, driving and cycling routes, demographic features, and points of interest—with the goal of estimating the impact of expanding Chicago’s bike lane network.

These contracts involve preferential treatment given to certain brands within the retailer. However, they are confidential, and empirical analysis has been limited. To study the prevalence and welfare impact of these contracts, I develop a novel approach to infer the presence of captaincy contracts based on preferential treatment in shelf placement and pricing. I first classify retailers into different captaincy types based on a brand × retailer specific quality of shelf placement inferred from a demand model. I then conduct pricing tests and find that captains, in line with theoretical predictions and industry anecdotes, eliminate double markups from their own products but not from competitor products. Comparative statics show that captaincy relationships increase the market share of the captain, but they can also increase consumer welfare by about 5% due to the elimination of double markups on the captain’s products.","{'sections': [{'criterion': 'Modal Verb Strength', 'justification': 'Uses the weak-to-moderate modal “can” (“they can also increase consumer welfare by about 5%”) and no strong modals like “will” or “cannot.”', 'score': 3}, {'criterion': 'Hedging Frequency & Type', 'justification': 'Limited hedging: the modal “can” and the approximator “about 5%”; no stance phrases like “it seems” or “we believe.”', 'score': 8}, {'criterion': 'Qualifier Density', 'justification': 'Few softening modifiers; notable qualifiers are “about 5%” and “certain brands.”', 'score': 8}, {'criterion': 'Acknowledgement of Limitations', 'justification': 'Explicit caveat: “they are confidential, and empirical analysis has been limited.”', 'score': 6}, {'criterion': 'Caution-Signaling Connectors', 'justification': 'One occurrence of a caution connector: “However, they are confidential ….”', 'score': 5}, {'criterion': 'Assertiveness & Voice', 'justification': 'Multiple unequivocal reporting verbs: “I develop…,” “I first classify…,” “I then conduct… and find that…,” “Comparative statics show that….”', 'score': 8}, {'criterion': 'Active/Passive Voice Ratio', 'justification': 'Predominantly active (“retailers delegate…,” “I develop…,” “I then conduct… and find…”); a few passives/statives (“they are confidential,” “analysis has been limited”).', 'score': 9}, {'criterion': 'Sentence Length & Directness', 'justification': 'Mix of multi-clausal sentences (“I then conduct pricing tests and find that…”) and shorter direct ones (“These contracts involve preferential treatment…”).

However, on platforms such as VolunteerMatch, which has facilitated millions of connections between volunteers and nonprofits, a sizable fraction of website traffic arrives directly to a nonprofit’s volunteering page via an external link, thus bypassing the platform’s recommendation algorithm. We study how such platforms should account for thisexternal trafficin the design of their recommendation algorithms, given the goal of maximizing successful matches. We model the platform’s problem as a special case of online matching, where (using VolunteerMatch terminology) volunteers arrive sequentially and probabilistically match with one opportunity, each of which has a finite need for volunteers. In our framework, external traffic is interested only in their targeted opportunity; by contrast,internal trafficmay be interested in many opportunities, and the platform’s online algorithm selects which opportunity to recommend. In evaluating the performance of different algorithms, we refine the notion of competitive ratio by parameterizing it based on the amount of external traffic. After demonstrating the shortcomings of a commonly used algorithm that is optimal in the absence of external traffic, we propose a new algorithm, adaptive capacity (AC), which accounts for matches differently based on whether they originate from internal or external traffic. We provide a lower bound onAC’s competitive ratio that is increasing in the amount of external traffic and that is close to (and, in some regimes, exactly matches) the parameterized upper bound we establish on the competitive ratio of any online algorithm. We complement our theoretical results with a numerical study motivated by VolunteerMatch data where we demonstrate the strong performance ofACrelative to current practice and further our understanding of the difference betweenACand other commonly used algorithms.","{'sections': [{'criterion': 'Modal Verb Strength', 'justification': 'Includes both weak and stronger modals: weak “may” (“internal traffic may be interested”) and stronger/deontic “should” (“platforms should account for this external traffic”).

We find that CIR positively predicts future stock returns of retail firms in the cross-section and that the predictability cannot be explained by weather reasons. We provide evidence that CIR indeed captures the information asymmetry among investors. The profitability of short selling is more pronounced on clear days. The return predictability of CIR is more pronounced in preannouncement periods. During cloudy days, parking lot traffic data from satellite images are harder to obtain, and the retail store sales estimated using parking lot data are noisier. We further show that high CIR is associated with low liquidity and that the decrease in liquidity purchases is greater than the decrease in liquidity sales. Our empirical analyses suggest that information asymmetry is priced and that CIR affects equity premiums through the liquidity channel, which are consistent with the theoretical predictions from a noisy rational expectations equilibrium model under imperfect competition.","{'sections': [{'criterion': 'Modal Verb Strength', 'justification': 'Uses strong modal “cannot” in “the predictability cannot be explained by weather reasons” and no weak modals like “may/might/could.”', 'score': 10}, {'criterion': 'Hedging Frequency & Type', 'justification': 'One hedge: “Our empirical analyses suggest that …”; otherwise assertive frames such as “We find…,” “We provide evidence…,” “We further show….”', 'score': 9}, {'criterion': 'Qualifier Density', 'justification': 'No softening qualifiers like “to some extent,” “relatively,” or “approximately.” Phrases such as “more pronounced” indicate comparative strength, not softening.', 'score': 10}, {'criterion': 'Acknowledgement of Limitations', 'justification': 'Multiple boundary-condition statements: “on clear days,” “in preannouncement periods,” and data constraints on “cloudy days … harder to obtain … noisier.”', 'score': 4}, {'criterion': 'Caution-Signaling Connectors', 'justification': 'No connectors such as “however,” “nevertheless,” or “on the other hand” appear.', 'score': 10}, {'criterion': 'Assertiveness & Voice', 'justification': 'Predominantly assertive verbs/frames: “provide,” “produces,” “We construct,” “We find,” “predicts,” “We provide evidence,” “We further show,” “is associated with”; only one tentative “suggest.”', 'score': 9}, {'criterion': 'Active/Passive Voice Ratio', 'justification': 'Frequent active constructions (“We construct,” “We find,” “We provide evidence,” “We further show”).

This creates batches of arrivals to the underlying queueing system. In this paper, we study the staffing problem for the batch arrival queue. We show that batches place a dangerous and deceptive stress on services, requiring a high amount of resources and exhibiting a fundamentally larger tail in those demands. This uncovers a service regime in which a system with large batch arrivals may have low utilization but will still have nontrivial waiting. Methodologically, these staffing results follow from novel large batch and large batch-and-rate limits of the multiserver queueing model. In the large batch limit, we establish the first formal connection between general multiserver queues and storage processes, another family of stochastic models. By consequence, we show that the batch scaled queue length process is not asymptotically normal and that, in fact, the fluid- and diffusion-type limits coincide.

We develop the operational data analytics (ODA) formulation of this problem that features a data-integration model and a validation model. The data-integration model consists of a class of functions called the operational statistics. Each operational statistic maps the available data to the ordering decision. The validation model finds, among the set of candidate operational statistics, the ordering decision that leads to the highest actual profit, which is unknown because of the unknown demand parameters. This ODA framework leads to a consistent estimate of the profit function with which we optimize the pricing decision. The derived quantity and price decisions demonstrate robust profit performance even when the sample size is very small in relation to the demand variability. Compared with the conventional approach with which the unknown parameters are estimated and then the decisions are optimized, the ODA framework produces significantly superior performance in the mean, standard deviation, and minimum of the profit, suggesting the robustness of the ODA solution especially in the small-sample regime.","{'sections': [{'criterion': 'Modal Verb Strength', 'justification': 'No modal auxiliaries like “may,” “might,” “will,” or “cannot” appear; clauses are predominantly indicative (e.g., “We study…”, “We develop…”, “This ODA framework leads…”).

Low-soil-tillage practices using an agricultural machine called the Happy Seeder, which can sow the new seed without removing the previous crop residue, have emerged as the most effective alternative to open burning. However, given the limited supply of Happy Seeders from the government, and the fact that farmers incur a significant yield loss if they delay sowing the new crop, farmers are often unwilling to wait to be processed by the Happy Seeder and, instead, burn their crop residue. We study how the government can use effective information-disclosure policies in the operation of Happy Seeders to minimize open burning. A Happy Seeder is assigned to process a group of farms. The government knows, but does not necessarily disclose, the Happy Seeder’s schedule at the start of the sowing season. We propose a class of information-disclosure policies, calleddilatory policies, that provide no information to the farmers about the schedule until a prespecifiedswitch periodand then reveal the entire schedule afterward. We show that an optimal dilatory policy can significantly lower the number of farms burnt compared with that under the full-disclosure and the no-disclosure policies. Using data from the rice-wheat crop system in northwestern India, we demonstrate that the optimal dilatory policy can reduce CO2and black-carbon emissions by 17% on average.

Using data from the rice-wheat crop system in northwestern India, we demonstrate that the optimal dilatory policy can reduce CO2and black-carbon emissions by 17% on average.

A common assessment mechanism compares the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the new health technology, relative to a standard of care, to a maximum threshold on the cost per quality-adjusted life year. In much research and practice, these assessments may not distinguish between cost-per-patient and negotiated price, effectively ignoring the value-based-pricing principle that better health outcomes merit higher prices. Other research makes this distinction, but it does not account for uncertainty in the ICER associated with clinical trial data that are limited in size and scope. This paper models the strategic behavior of a payer and a company as they price a new health technology, and it considers the use of conditional approval (CA) schemes whose post-marketing trials reduce ICER uncertainty before final pricing decisions are made. Analytical results suggest a very different view of the value-based pricing negotiations underlying these schemes: interim prices used during CA post-marketing trials should reflect cost-sharing for the CA scheme, not just cost-effectiveness goals for a treatment. Moreover, the types of caps on interim prices used by entities such as the UK Cancer Drugs Fund may hinder the development of new technologies and lead to suboptimal CA designs.

In shoppertainment sessions, streamers face bandwidth constraints so balance between providing product information and entertainment (such as singing, dancing, and storytelling). We conceptualize a shoppertainment live streamer as a novel type of online retail platform that maximizes total commissions from selling a range of manufacturer products. Our study investigates how streamers can leverage entertainment bandwidth as a long-term strategy to influence manufacturers’ pricing decisions and consumers’ attendance, as well as purchasing behaviors. Our model reveals several intriguing findings. First, we find that higher entertainment bandwidth encourages more manufacturers to adopt a demand-oriented, low-pricing strategy to attract buyers rather than a margin-oriented, high-pricing strategy that appeals only to buyers who perceive a high likelihood of finding a suitable product. Second, we observe that an increase in entertainment bandwidth initially boosts consumer traffic to shoppertainment sessions, but this trend may reverse once the bandwidth becomes excessively high, indicating an inverted U-shaped relationship. Conversely, the streamer’s expected profit per attending consumer first decreases and then increases with higher entertainment bandwidth, forming a U-shaped relationship. Third, our results suggest that a commission-maximizing streamer facing bandwidth constraints should not exclusively focus on providing product information. Instead, it is advantageous to allocate significant bandwidth to entertainment, even with limited entertaining capability, and potentially beneficial to dedicate all bandwidth to entertainment if the capability is substantial.

Wu,information systems,"Although prior research has primarily focused on the direct value of information technology (IT) and IT adoption by individuals and firms, this study explores the indirect value of IT in the form of public infrastructure technology. By exploiting a spatial discontinuity in water monitoring stations, we discover that firms located immediately upstream of water monitoring stations exhibit significantly lower levels of corruption than firms located immediately downstream. These findings are particularly noteworthy given that water monitoring stations have the potential to generate significant indirect value as they are not explicitly designed to mitigate corruption. Further analyses reveal that public infrastructure technology alone does not hold the key to mitigating corporate corruption.

To address this issue, we develop a factor model that captures the risks to long-term investors present in the intertemporal capital asset pricing model (ICAPM). Empirically, we construct intertemporal risk factors as long-short portfolios based on stock exposures to dividend yield and realized variance.

The supplier needs to decide on a production quantity by balancing the shortage cost and the excess inventory holding cost with respect to the retailer’s demand. The retailer’s demand is random, but the retailer receives an informative signal about the demand before the supplier sets the production quantity and places orders after learning the demand realization. The retailer wants to reduce the shortage cost, and to this end, the retailer can disclose information about the retailer’s signal to persuade the supplier to increase production levels.

The supplier needs to decide on a production quantity by balancing the shortage cost and the excess inventory holding cost with respect to the retailer’s demand. The retailer’s demand is random, but the retailer receives an informative signal about the demand before the supplier sets the production quantity and places orders after learning the demand realization. The retailer wants to reduce the shortage cost, and to this end, the retailer can disclose information about the retailer’s signal to persuade the supplier to increase production levels. For this setup, we characterize the optimal information disclosure policy of the retailer and shed light on settings in which the retailer strictly benefits from carefully designed information disclosure policies relative to a full- or a no-disclosure policy.","{'sections': [{'criterion': 'Modal Verb Strength', 'justification': 'Contains the weak modal ""can"" in ""the retailer can disclose""; no strong modals like ""will"" or ""cannot"" appear.', 'score': 1}, {'criterion': 'Hedging Frequency & Type', 'justification': 'No typical hedges like ""may,"" ""might,"" ""we believe""; one mild stance phrase ""shed light on"" suggests caution but is isolated.', 'score': 9}, {'criterion': 'Qualifier Density', 'justification': 'No softening qualifiers such as ""to some extent,"" ""relatively,"" or ""approximately""; instead, it uses a booster ""strictly"".', 'score': 10}, {'criterion': 'Acknowledgement of Limitations', 'justification': 'Explicit boundary phrasing ""For this setup"" and model scoping (""in a two-tier supply chain,"" ""single type of product""); only a single, brief caveat.', 'score': 8}, {'criterion': 'Caution-Signaling Connectors', 'justification': 'One contrastive connector ""but"" in ""demand is random, but the retailer receives...""; no ""however,"" ""nevertheless,"" or similar multiple markers.', 'score': 5}, {'criterion': 'Assertiveness & Voice', 'justification': 'Assertive verbs/phrases like ""studies,"" ""we characterize,"" and ""strictly benefits"" dominate; only a mild, tentative ""shed light on.""', 'score': 8}, {'criterion': 'Active/Passive Voice Ratio', 'justification': 'Predominantly active constructions: ""This paper studies...,"" ""The supplier needs to decide...,"" ""the retailer receives...,"" ""we characterize...""; no passives found.', 'score': 10}, {'criterion': 'Sentence Length & Directness', 'justification': 'Several multi-clausal sentences with multiple commas and coordinators (e.g., ""The retailer’s demand is random, but... and ... after..."").', 'score': 4}, {'criterion': 'Imperative-Form Occurrence', 'justification': 'No directives or command forms present.', 'score': 1}, {'criterion': 'Pronoun Commitment', 'justification': 'Mix of impersonal framing (""This paper studies,"" ""The supplier..."") and first-person (""we characterize""); moderate first-person presence.', 'score': 6}, {'criterion': 'Novelty-Claim Strength', 'justification': 'No explicit originality claims such as ""first,"" ""novel,"" or ""new""; contribution stated as ""we characterize"" without novelty boosters.', 'score': 1}, {'criterion': 'Jargon/Technicality Density', 'justification': 'Multiple specialized terms: ""information design problem,"" ""two-tier supply chain,"" ""shortage cost,"" ""excess inventory holding cost,"" ""informative signal,"" ""demand realization,"" ""information disclosure policy.""', 'score': 8}, {'criterion': 'Emotional Valence', 'justification': 'Neutral wording; no emotionally charged adjectives (e.g., ""revolutionary,"" ""urgent"").', 'score': 1}, {'criterion': 'Evidence & Citation Usage', 'justification': 'No data, statistics, or literature citations are provided in the abstract.', 'score': 1}, {'criterion': 'Practical/Impact Orientation', 'justification': 'No explicit application, policy, or practice implications stated; focus remains on characterization of a policy.', 'score': 1}, {'criterion': 'Readability', 'justification': 'Meaning is generally clear but tempered by technical terminology and long, clause-heavy sentences.', 'score': 6}]}",1,9.0,10,8,5,8,10,4,1.0,6,1,8,1,1,1,6,Huseyin Gurkan,54_1,male,0.8074982970787066,2,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,1

This creates batches of arrivals to the underlying queueing system. In this paper, we study the staffing problem for the batch arrival queue. We show that batches place a dangerous and deceptive stress on services, requiring a high amount of resources and exhibiting a fundamentally larger tail in those demands. This uncovers a service regime in which a system with large batch arrivals may have low utilization but will still have nontrivial waiting. Methodologically, these staffing results follow from novel large batch and large batch-and-rate limits of the multiserver queueing model. In the large batch limit, we establish the first formal connection between general multiserver queues and storage processes, another family of stochastic models. By consequence, we show that the batch scaled queue length process is not asymptotically normal and that, in fact, the fluid- and diffusion-type limits coincide. Hence, the (safety) staffing of this system must be directly proportional to the batch size just to achieve a nondegenerate probability of wait. In exhibition of the existence and insights of this large batch regime, we apply our results to data on Covid-19 contact tracing in New York City. In doing so, we identify significant benefits produced by the tracing agency’s decision to staff above national recommendations, and we also demonstrate that there may have been an opportunity to further improve the operation by optimizing the arrival pattern in the public health data pipeline.","{'sections': [{'criterion': 'Modal Verb Strength', 'justification': 'Mix of weak and strong modals: weak—""can arrive,"" ""may have low utilization,"" ""may have been an opportunity""; strong—""will still have,"" ""must be directly proportional.""', 'score': 5}, {'criterion': 'Hedging Frequency & Type', 'justification': 'Occasional hedges via modals: ""may have low utilization,"" ""may have been an opportunity.""

Moreover, when the retailer offers freshness-based price discounts, we find that less fresh supply leads to less food waste. In contrast, when the supplier adjusts the wholesale price based on freshness, less fresh supply causes more food waste. We also generalize our findings to the cases of (i) dual sourcing, (ii) noisy measurements in the Internet of Things sensors feeding data into blockchain, and (iii) the retailer’s culling processes.","{'sections': [{'criterion': 'Modal Verb Strength', 'justification': 'Multiple uses of “can” (“can adopt,” “can increase,” “can decrease”) and no occurrences of weak modals like “may/might” or strong modals like “will/cannot.”', 'score': 5}, {'criterion': 'Hedging Frequency & Type', 'justification': 'Occasional hedging via “can” (possibility) and “about only 4%,” while many statements are direct (“we quantify,” “we provide,” “we design,” “we find”).', 'score': 8}, {'criterion': 'Qualifier Density', 'justification': 'Few softening modifiers; notable instance is “about only 4%.” Most claims lack softening phrases like “to some extent” or “relatively.”', 'score': 8}, {'criterion': 'Acknowledgement of Limitations', 'justification': 'No explicit caveats such as “may not generalize” or “within this context.” The Walmart strawberry example specifies context but is not framed as a limitation.', 'score': 9}, {'criterion': 'Caution-Signaling Connectors', 'justification': 'Concessive/contrastive connectors appear occasionally: “Despite this…,” “In contrast,” alongside additive “Moreover.”', 'score': 5}, {'criterion': 'Assertiveness & Voice', 'justification': 'Frequent unequivocal reporting verbs (“we quantify,” “we provide,” “We design,” “we find,” “We also generalize”) with some tentative outcomes via “can increase/decrease.”', 'score': 8}, {'criterion': 'Active/Passive Voice Ratio', 'justification': 'Predominantly active constructions with explicit agents (“we consider,” “We quantify,” “We design,” “we find”; “The retailer can adopt”).

In Germany, PER is legally mandated for firms with more than 2,000 domestic employees, but not for those below this threshold. Exploiting this discontinuity, we show that PER has heterogeneous effects on firms operating in diverse environments. For firms experiencing positive growth, PER increases their responsiveness to investment opportunities, suggesting that employee participation increases firms’ ability to exploit growth options. The effect through growth options is particularly salient in situations in which growth options are highly valuable. In contrast, for firms experiencing negative growth, PER reduces investment responsiveness, suggesting that employees resist the exercise of abandonment options. This effect is more pronounced in firms with high labor intensity, in which employees are likely to have a strong voice. Furthermore, operational risk moderates the effects of employee representation––the positive effect through growth options is attenuated in high-risk firms and the negative effect through abandonment options is exacerbated, thereby suggesting that employee board representatives are less interested in pursuing growth where businesses are relatively risky, and they protect their constituents more forcefully in high-risk environments. Moreover, the positive effect of PER on exploiting growth options is attenuated by collective bargaining agreements, while its effect through abandonment options is little affected.

In Germany, PER is legally mandated for firms with more than 2,000 domestic employees, but not for those below this threshold. Exploiting this discontinuity, we show that PER has heterogeneous effects on firms operating in diverse environments. For firms experiencing positive growth, PER increases their responsiveness to investment opportunities, suggesting that employee participation increases firms’ ability to exploit growth options. The effect through growth options is particularly salient in situations in which growth options are highly valuable. In contrast, for firms experiencing negative growth, PER reduces investment responsiveness, suggesting that employees resist the exercise of abandonment options. This effect is more pronounced in firms with high labor intensity, in which employees are likely to have a strong voice. Furthermore, operational risk moderates the effects of employee representation––the positive effect through growth options is attenuated in high-risk firms and the negative effect through abandonment options is exacerbated, thereby suggesting that employee board representatives are less interested in pursuing growth where businesses are relatively risky, and they protect their constituents more forcefully in high-risk environments. Moreover, the positive effect of PER on exploiting growth options is attenuated by collective bargaining agreements, while its effect through abandonment options is little affected. Evidence from stock price behavior further supports the viewpoint that employee representation affects capital investment.

This paper models the strategic behavior of a payer and a company as they price a new health technology, and it considers the use of conditional approval (CA) schemes whose post-marketing trials reduce ICER uncertainty before final pricing decisions are made. Analytical results suggest a very different view of the value-based pricing negotiations underlying these schemes: interim prices used during CA post-marketing trials should reflect cost-sharing for the CA scheme, not just cost-effectiveness goals for a treatment. Moreover, the types of caps on interim prices used by entities such as the UK Cancer Drugs Fund may hinder the development of new technologies and lead to suboptimal CA designs. We propose a new risk-sharing mechanism to remedy this. Numerical results, calibrated to approval data of an oncology drug, illustrate the issues in a practical setting.","{'sections': [{'criterion': 'Modal Verb Strength', 'justification': 'Multiple weak modals appear: ""may not distinguish,"" ""may hinder""; a moderate modal ""should reflect"" occurs once; no strong modals like ""will,"" ""must,"" or ""cannot"" appear.', 'score': 2}, {'criterion': 'Hedging Frequency & Type', 'justification': 'Hedging markers include ""may not,"" ""Analytical results suggest,"" ""may hinder,"" and the frequency hedge ""often.""', 'score': 3}, {'criterion': 'Qualifier Density', 'justification': 'Few softening modifiers; notable examples are the frequency qualifier ""often"" and the descriptive limitation phrase ""limited in size and scope.""

The increased demand leads to a higher price but a smaller quantity of shared data. If the firm’s revenue is largely usage based rather than data based, then both the firm’s profit and consumer surplus increase after the GDPR, implying that the GDPR can be welfare improving. But if the firm’s revenue is largely from data monetization, then the GDPR can reduce the firm’s profit and consumer surplus.","{'sections': [{'criterion': 'Modal Verb Strength', 'justification': 'Uses only weak possibility modals: ""can be welfare improving"" and ""can reduce""; no strong modals like ""will"", ""must"", or ""cannot"" appear.', 'score': 1}, {'criterion': 'Hedging Frequency & Type', 'justification': 'Limited hedging via possibility modals ""can be"" and ""can reduce""; no stance phrases like ""we believe"" or ""it seems""; strong declaratives such as ""We show"" also appear.', 'score': 7}, {'criterion': 'Qualifier Density', 'justification': 'Softening qualifiers appear but are sparse: ""largely usage based"" and ""largely from data monetization""; few other attenuating modifiers.', 'score': 8}, {'criterion': 'Acknowledgement of Limitations', 'justification': 'Explicit boundary conditions through conditionals: ""If the firm’s revenue is largely usage based..."" and ""if the firm’s revenue is largely from data monetization"".', 'score': 6}, {'criterion': 'Caution-Signaling Connectors', 'justification': 'Contrastive connectors used occasionally: ""but a smaller quantity of shared data"" and sentence-initial ""But if..."".', 'score': 5}, {'criterion': 'Assertiveness & Voice', 'justification': 'Assertive verbs dominate: ""We show that the GDPR boosts demand"", ""The increased demand leads""; tempered by tentative outcomes ""can be"" and ""can reduce"".', 'score': 8}, {'criterion': 'Active/Passive Voice Ratio', 'justification': 'Predominantly active constructions: ""We study"", ""We show"", ""The increased demand leads""; no clear passive forms present.', 'score': 10}, {'criterion': 'Sentence Length & Directness', 'justification': 'Mix of one very long, multi-clausal opening sentence and several direct, mid-length sentences (e.g., ""We show that the GDPR boosts demand..."").', 'score': 7}, {'criterion': 'Imperative-Form Occurrence', 'justification': 'No imperatives or direct commands; all statements are declarative or conditional.', 'score': 1}, {'criterion': 'Pronoun Commitment', 'justification': 'First person appears explicitly: ""We study"", ""We show""; remainder uses impersonal constructions.', 'score': 7}, {'criterion': 'Novelty-Claim Strength', 'justification': 'No originality claims such as ""first to"" or ""novel"" are present.', 'score': 1}, {'criterion': 'Jargon/Technicality Density', 'justification': 'Moderate technical terms: ""General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)"", ""opt-in requirement"", ""heterogeneous in their valuations"", ""consumer surplus"", ""welfare improving"", ""data monetization"".', 'score': 6}, {'criterion': 'Emotional Valence', 'justification': 'Language remains neutral; no emotionally charged adjectives (e.g., ""revolutionary"", ""urgent"").', 'score': 1}, {'criterion': 'Evidence & Citation Usage', 'justification': 'No data, statistics, or literature citations provided; claims are presented without evidential backing within the abstract.', 'score': 1}, {'criterion': 'Practical/Impact Orientation', 'justification': 'Mentions policy-relevant outcomes (""profit and consumer surplus"", ""welfare improving""), suggesting possible practical implications, but no explicit application or policy directives.', 'score': 5}, {'criterion': 'Readability', 'justification': 'Generally clear and precise with logical flow; minor complexity in the first sentence but overall easy to follow.', 'score': 8}]}",1,7.0,8,6,5,8,10,7,1.0,7,1,6,1,1,5,8,Shiva Shekhar,70_2,male,0.5885232190173363,3,0.0,0,0.0,0,0,1

The players have additive values for the goods. The prior distributions of those values are common knowledge. We consider both the cases of independent values and values that are correlated across players (as occurs when there is a common-value component). We describe the structure of optimal divisions in the divide-and-choose game and identify several cases where it is possible to efficiently compute equilibria. An approximation algorithm is presented for the case when the distribution over the chooser’s value for each good follows a normal distribution, along with a randomized approximation algorithm for the case of uniform distributions over intervals. A mixture of analytic results and computational simulations illuminates several striking differences between optimal strategies in the cases of known versus unknown preferences. Most notably, given unknown preferences, the divider has a compelling “diversification” incentive in creating the chooser’s two options. This incentive leads to multiple goods being divided at equilibrium, quite contrary to the divider’s optimal strategy when preferences are known. In many contexts, such as buy-and-sell provisions between partners, or in judging fairness, it is important to assess the relative expected utilities of the divider and chooser.

The players have additive values for the goods. The prior distributions of those values are common knowledge. We consider both the cases of independent values and values that are correlated across players (as occurs when there is a common-value component). We describe the structure of optimal divisions in the divide-and-choose game and identify several cases where it is possible to efficiently compute equilibria. An approximation algorithm is presented for the case when the distribution over the chooser’s value for each good follows a normal distribution, along with a randomized approximation algorithm for the case of uniform distributions over intervals. A mixture of analytic results and computational simulations illuminates several striking differences between optimal strategies in the cases of known versus unknown preferences. Most notably, given unknown preferences, the divider has a compelling “diversification” incentive in creating the chooser’s two options. This incentive leads to multiple goods being divided at equilibrium, quite contrary to the divider’s optimal strategy when preferences are known. In many contexts, such as buy-and-sell provisions between partners, or in judging fairness, it is important to assess the relative expected utilities of the divider and chooser. Those utilities, we show, depend on the players’ levels of knowledge about each other’s values, the correlations between the players’ values, and the number of goods being divided. Under fairly mild assumptions, we show that the chooser is strictly better off for a small number of goods, whereas the divider is strictly better off for a large number of goods.","{'sections': [{'criterion': 'Modal Verb Strength', 'justification': 'No modal verbs like “may/might” (weak) or “will/cannot” (strong) appear.

In this paper, we introduce a nonparametric approach to directly measure higher-order Arrow-Pratt coefficients of risk aversion in an expected utility framework using choices between compound lotteries and show how it can be easily implemented in behavioral studies. Specifically, we provide a theoretical basis for using risk apportionment to reveal the intensity of higher-order risk attitudes, and then draw upon our theoretical results to develop a simple, systematic, and generalizable procedure for eliciting higher-order Arrow-Pratt coefficients. We demonstrate our approach in a laboratory experiment and find that the modal second-order, third-order, and fourth-order Arrow-Pratt coefficients are positive and small. Further, we find that degrees of risk aversion are positively correlated across orders.

Unlike public regulations that mandate uniform compliance, many platforms grant a more flexible time window for complementors to adopt privacy policies. Although several studies have examined the impact of privacy policies, the consequences of delayed policy adoption under time flexibility remain largely unexplored. This study is among the first to investigate the impact of apps delaying policy adoption in the context of a privacy policy change. The context of our research is the upgrade to Android version 6.0, which gave consumers more control over their personal data. Apps were given a three-year grace period to adopt the new privacy policy, during which apps that did not adopt the policy could still run on the latest Android version. We leverage this variation in policy adoption by apps to examine its impact on apps’ marketplace outcomes. By installing over 13,691 popular apps on emulators, we detect exactly when each app upgrades to version 6.0. We combine this unique data set with multiple data sets to quantify the impact of delaying the upgrade. We find that delaying the upgrade results in a significant loss of downloads and user ratings for apps. Frequently maintaining the apps without upgrading can only partially mitigate these declines.

Unlike public regulations that mandate uniform compliance, many platforms grant a more flexible time window for complementors to adopt privacy policies. Although several studies have examined the impact of privacy policies, the consequences of delayed policy adoption under time flexibility remain largely unexplored. This study is among the first to investigate the impact of apps delaying policy adoption in the context of a privacy policy change. The context of our research is the upgrade to Android version 6.0, which gave consumers more control over their personal data. Apps were given a three-year grace period to adopt the new privacy policy, during which apps that did not adopt the policy could still run on the latest Android version. We leverage this variation in policy adoption by apps to examine its impact on apps’ marketplace outcomes. By installing over 13,691 popular apps on emulators, we detect exactly when each app upgrades to version 6.0. We combine this unique data set with multiple data sets to quantify the impact of delaying the upgrade. We find that delaying the upgrade results in a significant loss of downloads and user ratings for apps. Frequently maintaining the apps without upgrading can only partially mitigate these declines. In further examining who delays upgrades and why, we find that apps that display in-app advertising and overreach for permissions are more likely to delay upgrading, suggesting a strategic trade-off between marketplace outcomes and the ability to collect data continuously. The findings of our study highlight the need to carefully consider participants’ potential strategic behaviors in designing policy implementation.

SA coverage promotes corporate innovation by disseminating innovation-related information about the covered firm to external investors, thereby alleviating the firm’s financial constraints. Moreover, firms with higher information asymmetry, firms facing greater product market competition, and firms having lower levels of managerial short-termism reveal a greater increase in innovation outcomes following SA coverage initiation.

",2023-11-26,2024-07-24,2024-10-07,241,2024,10,Joshua Gans,business strategy,"By design, the Bitcoin protocol has a low throughput. The Lightning Network (LN) is a layer-two solution built to increase throughput by cryptographically securing commitments to transactions and only occasionally converting cumulative balances into on-chain transactions. LN channels enable payments between nodes connected by a path of channels. The payment flow through a channel determines its cost. Different channel topologies can support the same underlying flows but impose different costs. This paper obtains necessary conditions for cost-minimizing topologies by identifying local cost-reducing strategies. The first local strategy entails repositioning of channels. The second entails adding hubs to handle the flows of groups of nodes. The paper also evaluates the efficiency of a global configuration, obtaining bounds on the minimum cost topology and showing the unusual circumstances in which the cost minimal structure is a hub that connects to all other nodes.","{'sections': [{'criterion': 'Modal Verb Strength', 'justification': 'Only weak modal occurs: “can support.” No strong modals like “will,” “must,” or “cannot” appear.', 'score': 1}, {'criterion': 'Hedging Frequency & Type', 'justification': 'No hedging terms or stance phrases (e.g., “may,” “might,” “it seems,” “we believe”) are present.', 'score': 10}, {'criterion': 'Qualifier Density', 'justification': 'No softening qualifiers such as “to some extent,” “relatively,” “approximately,” or “generally” appear.', 'score': 10}, {'criterion': 'Acknowledgement of Limitations', 'justification': 'No explicit caveats or boundary statements (e.g., “within context,” “may not generalize,” “limitations”) are mentioned.', 'score': 10}, {'criterion': 'Caution-Signaling Connectors', 'justification': 'One contrastive connector appears: “but” in “can support the same underlying flows but impose different costs.” No “however,” “nevertheless,” etc.', 'score': 5}, {'criterion': 'Assertiveness & Voice', 'justification': 'Predominantly unequivocal verbs and statements: “has,” “is,” “enable,” “determines,” “obtains necessary conditions,” “entails,” “evaluates,” “obtaining bounds,” “showing.” Only one tentative “can support.”', 'score': 9}, {'criterion': 'Active/Passive Voice Ratio', 'justification': 'Mostly active constructions (e.g., “LN channels enable…,” “The payment flow… determines…,” “This paper obtains…,” “The paper also evaluates…”).

Our findings indicate that under exogenous default risk, although platform financing exposes the platform to the seller’s default risk, it can enhance the seller’s sales by providing low-rate finance and reducing the wholesale price because the supplier remains isolated from default risk. Platform financing emerges in equilibrium, benefiting all parties, particularly in businesses facing significant default risk, high product costs, operating in small markets, or having a high commission rate.
